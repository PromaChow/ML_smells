Analysis results for /Users/promachowdhury/ml_smells/inital.py:

Framework-Specific Smells:
- Column Selection Checker
  Framework: Pandas
  How to fix: Select necessary columns after importing DataFrame.
  Benefits: Clarifies data usage and improves performance.

- Deterministic Algorithm Usage Checker
  Framework: PyTorch
  How to fix: Enable deterministic algorithms using torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True).
  Benefits: Ensures consistent results across different hardware and runs.

- Model Evaluation Checker
  Framework: PyTorch
  How to fix: Set model to evaluation mode using model.eval().
  Benefits: Ensures correct behavior of layers like BatchNorm and Dropout during inference.
